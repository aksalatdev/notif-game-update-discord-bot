<p>The holiday season is about to become even more exciting for VALORANT fans — rumors and discussions within the community indicate that the cherished winter event mode, Snowball Fight, is making a comeback. If you’ve been longing for those exhilarating, snowball-packed matches and the festive atmosphere, now is the perfect time to jump back in.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Snowball Fight in VALORANT</h2><p>Engage in the exhilarating Snowball Fight, a dynamic 5v5 team-deathmatch mode where traditional weapons and abilities are swapped for the ultimate Snowball Launcher. In this frosty battleground, every snowball hit delivers an instant kill, ramping up the excitement and competition!</p><p>Players trade in traditional guns and abilities for the launcher’s unique projectile-based snowballs, which feature an arc and travel time. They can also collect special power-ups that are dropped as “gifts” scattered throughout the map. Discover an array of exciting power-ups: Growball, where snowballs expand mid-air; Rapid Fire, delivering an impressive increase in fire rate; Ricochet, allowing snowballs to bounce off surfaces; and Skates, enhancing your speed and jump height.</p><p>Matches unfold swiftly, typically lasting between 5 to 7 minutes, with the objective being to reach 50 kills first. Launched with patch 1.14 in December 2020, Snowball Fight swiftly captured the hearts of players, thanks to its cheerful mechanics and delightful holiday spirit.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the Leak Suggests — Is Snowball Fight Really Coming Back?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snowball Fight will be returning for the holidays. It will also be coming to Console. | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a><a href="https://t.co/tnibqYjGya">pic.twitter.com/tnibqYjGya</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1995906332679905427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Recent social-media leaks have claimed that Snowball Fight will return to VALORANT this holiday season. While official confirmation is not yet out, these rumors have reignited hope among fans.</li><li>Given the mode’s history as a limited-time seasonal event and fans’ repeated requests, it makes sense for developers to bring it back during winter — especially if they want to boost engagement during the holidays.</li></ul><p>Should the return be genuine, players could anticipate the comeback of Snowball Fight in the near future — potentially featuring holiday skins and bundles, winter-themed map adjustments, or even additional seasonal content.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Snowball Fight: Return, Removal &amp; Fan Demand</h2><p>Snowball Fight made its debut in December 2020, coinciding with VALORANT’s inaugural holiday season event. In response to overwhelming interest, the mode made its comeback in December 2021, reinstated by community votes, and continued through early January 2022.</p><p>Since that time, the mode has been missing. Starting in 2024–2025, Snowball Fight will no longer be included in the standard mode rotation. The community&#8217;s enthusiasm is palpable: players fondly remember the joyous and lively spirit of snowball launches, power-ups, and holiday celebrations — and they have consistently expressed their desire for these experiences to make a comeback, particularly during the festive season.</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/winter-is-coming-snowball-fight-returns-to-valorant-this-holiday/">Winter Is Coming: Snowball Fight Returns To VALORANT This Holiday</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

<p>Attention VALORANT players! Patch 11.11 has officially dropped. While it may not be a colossal update, it introduces several crucial enhancements behind the scenes, along with the highly anticipated gifting feature you&#8217;ve all been waiting for. This patch is essential if you’ve been eager to send VP or desire a more flawless gaming experience.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s New in Patch 11.11: Bug Fixes &amp; More</h2><p>Patch 11.11 focuses heavily on bug fixes across agents and maps, plus a few quality-of-life improvements. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent Bugs Squashed</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Chamber</strong> — fixed a bug where the audio for his teleport (Rendezvous) would sometimes end abruptly near animation completion.</li><li><strong>Clove</strong> — multiple fixes: skin-finisher glitches if Clove is killed immediately after using Not Dead Yet; fix for agent-icon display when killed inside smoke; corrected revive behavior in spawn if body was obstructed; UI fix so overheal effects don’t linger after overheal drops.</li><li><strong>Cypher</strong> — fixed minimap issues that briefly revealed enemy positions even when hidden by Cyber Cage, corrected Spycam/Trapwire visuals when interrupted by death or destruction. </li><li><strong>Jett</strong> — resolved a bug where she could get stuck mid-air around ledges or box corners. </li><li><strong>Harbor</strong> — various fixes: Storm Surge affecting agents incorrectly (e.g., affecting invisibility-based abilities), ability-angle glitches, minimap-indicator bugs for Reckoning, spectator-view VFX issues, etc.</li><li>And other agents too — fixes for agents like Phoenix, Reyna, Skye, Tejo, Iso — addressing issues ranging from HUD/in-game UI bugs to ability-state inconsistencies.</li></ul><h4 class="wp-block-heading"> Map Fixes</h4><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>On map Haven: wall-penetration bug near A-Link/A-Site has been fixed.</li></ul><p>These fixes should smooth out many frustrating bugs players reported recently — improving fairness, clarity, and overall gameplay experience.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Feature: VP Gifting Is Here</h2><p>One of the biggest additions in Patch 11.11 is the new <strong>VP gifting feature</strong> (PC only). Instead of trying to guess which skin or bundle your friend wants, you can now send them raw VP — letting them choose what they want. </p><p>The rollout starts December 3rd (PT) and should gradually reach all players.</p><p>This is especially handy during the holiday season or if you want to gift skins but aren’t sure about someone’s preferences.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">UI Improvements &amp; Minor Tweaks</h2><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Agents page got a redesign: it now displays all agents in a <strong>grid view</strong> (instead of horizontal rows), making navigation smoother. </li><li>Collections UI updates (carried over from the previous patch) are now live in regions like Korea.</li><li>Developers also dropped a hint of a “festive surprise” coming soon — possibly an end-of-year event or cosmetic drop.</li></ul><p>Patch 11.11 may be one of the lighter updates for 2025, but it brings meaningful quality-of-life fixes, a long-awaited gifting system, and UI improvements that improve the daily VALORANT experience. If you play consistently — or have friends you want to gift VP — now’s a solid time to jump back in.</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-patch-11-11-vp-gifting-bug-fixes-quality-of-life-changes/">VALORANT Patch 11.11: VP Gifting, Bug Fixes &amp; Quality-of-Life Changes</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

<p>Excitement is in the air among VALORANT fans as whispers of a potential sequel to the original Mystbloom Bundle — known as “Mystbloom 2.0” — begin to circulate. The original Mystbloom captured attention in spring 2024 with its enchanting pastel, lotus-inspired skins and a vibrant pink aesthetic that stood out from the game’s usual darker skinlines.</p><p>A recent post on social media, shared by an account dedicated to leaks, seems to be the source of the 2.0 rumor. An article from 2025 highlights that this version aligns perfectly with the enduring appeal of the original bundle: Historically, 2.0 editions have emerged when a skinline truly connected with players. The leaked visuals suggest an enhanced iteration of the original’s gentle color palette, potentially reimagining certain aesthetics and effects.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Look at Mystbloom 2.0 — What We Know So Far</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW COLLECTION: Mystbloom 2.0 | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a><br><br>Includes: Vandal, Outlaw, Ghost, and Fan Melee <a href="https://t.co/KWNZTtKXp0">pic.twitter.com/KWNZTtKXp0</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1994499497515454723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure><p><strong>Mystbloom 2.0 Features: </strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Vandal, </li><li>Outlaw, </li><li>Ghost, </li><li>Fan Melee</li></ul><p>If the leak proves accurate, Mystbloom 2.0 could deliver upgraded skins to players who loved the first batch — or to those who missed out the first time around.

The base bundle came in at 8,700 VP, approximately equivalent to US $85, although specific pricing could differ by region.</p><p>When offered individually, the weapons in Mystbloom cost 2,175 VP each for the standard gun skins, while the melee skin (Mystbloom Kunai) costs 4,350 VP.</p><p>The bundle offered an impressive array beyond just guns — owners were treated to a complete collection of skins (Phantom, Judge, Sheriff, Operator, and Kunai melee), accompanied by a gun buddy, player card, spray, and the standard upgradeable VFX/finisher/kill-banner package that typically accompanies premium bundles in VALORANT.</p><p>If Mystbloom 2.0 retains the original structure, it will probably maintain comparable pricing. However, considering factors like inflation, content updates, or additional features, a modest price increase could be anticipated.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mystbloom 2.0 Release Date</h2><p>Mystbloom 2.0 has been generating buzz since a leak surfaced in late November 2025. However, there’s still no official word from the game developers to confirm the excitement. Players should approach any rumors with a healthy dose of skepticism. If Riot Games sticks to its established pattern for previous “.0” releases, we might expect a drop around the next major act or patch update. This positions early 2026 as a plausible timeframe to keep an eye on.</p><p>For now, this leak is still unverified, and fans are encouraged to hold out for an official trailer or announcement from VALORANT’s official channels.</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-mystbloom-2-0-skin-bundle-first-look-price-release-date/">VALORANT Mystbloom 2.0 Skin Bundle: First Look, Price, &amp; Release Date</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

<p>Attention VALORANT fans! Exciting leaks indicate that a fresh “Run It Back // V25” skin line could be on the horizon. If you&#8217;re craving that pristine gun-skin sparkle, this enticing bundle might just be your next essential purchase. Let’s analyze the information we have gathered, distinguish between what’s confirmed and what’s merely speculation, and assess if the anticipation is justified.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is “Run It Back” in VALORANT</h2><p>The “Run It Back” collection in VALORANT offers players a fantastic opportunity to snag previously released weapon skins all at once, eliminating the need to wait for them to pop up randomly in the daily store. Don’t miss your chance to enhance your arsenal with this exciting bundle!</p><p>Traditionally, “Run It Back” bundles feature skins from previous collections, often covering several years, providing a streamlined selection at a more attractive price than purchasing skins separately.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the Leak Suggests: First Look</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW CAPSULE: Run It Back // V25 | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a><a href="https://t.co/WfGzokZZsX">pic.twitter.com/WfGzokZZsX</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1995905301212516518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure><p>A recent social media leak, shared by a well-known VALORANT leaker account, is creating quite a buzz in the community with hints about a “Run It Back // V25 Skin Bundle.” Although specifics are limited, the excitement is palpable:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A bundle consolidating multiple older premium skins</li><li>A probable return of fan-favorite skins that some players missed out on earlier.</li><li>The “V25” tag suggests this might coincide with VALORANT’s 25th major content cycle</li></ul><p>Given that this information stems from leaks rather than an official announcement, it&#8217;s wise to approach these details with a degree of skepticism. However, should they prove accurate, it could represent a significant release for collectors and enthusiasts alike.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Anticipated Price </h2><p>Looking at previous “Run It Back” releases offers some guidance:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The base “Run It Back” bundles in earlier episodes historically ranged around <strong>4,972 to 5,950 VALORANT Points (VP),</strong> depending on the number and quality of skins included. </li><li>A larger bundle with more skins and accessories would logically cost higher — possibly pushing toward <strong>6,000 VP or slightly above</strong>, especially if premium skins are included.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Speculated Release Window</h2><p>Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Run It Back // V25 — just some leaks circulating. We can draw some insightful conclusions: The mention of “V25” suggests a fresh content cycle, indicating that the bundle might align with a patch release or act update — positioning it as a clever move to enhance engagement.</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valroant-run-it-back-v25-first-look-release-date-price/">VALROANT Run It Back V25: First Look, Release Date, Price</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

From speedster Jett to toxic Viper, every one of them has a unique voice line that demonstrates their personality. In the process, it gives every agent more depth in their character.</p><p>Additionally, these ultimate voice lines also behave differently depending on whom you are interacting with at the exact moment when you use your ultimate utility. For example, if your allies are close and you are Raze, the voice line warns your teammates of the incoming rockets. In comparison, your opponents will get an entirely different voice line depending on where the ability was activated.</p><p>As such, these voice lines become essential sound cues for incoming attacks. Knowing when to take cover in the case of incoming damage-dealing ultimate ability can be the difference between winning and losing a round.</p><p>Players of all skill buckets need to remember each of these voice lines in their heads to win rounds. </p><p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://gameriv.com/best-valorant-crosshair-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best VALORANT Crosshair &amp; Codes</a></strong></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-all-the-ultimate-voice-lines"><strong>All the Ultimate voice lines</strong></h2><p><strong>Viper </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Don&#8217;t get in my way!&#8221;<br><strong>Viper </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Welcome to my world!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Jett </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Watch this!&#8221;<br><strong>Jett </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Get out of my way!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Breach </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;<br><strong>Breach </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Off your feet!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Raze </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Here comes the party!&#8221;<br><strong>Raze </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Fire in the hole!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Reyna </strong>(Ally): &#8220;They will cower!&#8221;<br><strong>Reyna </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;The hunt begins!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Phoenix </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;<br><strong>Phoenix </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Jokes over, you&#8217;re dead!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Cypher </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Where is everyone hiding?&#8221;<br><strong>Cypher </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;I know EXACTLY where you are.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Omen</strong>  (Ally): &#8220;Watch them run!&#8221;<br><strong>Omen </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Scatter!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Sova </strong>(Ally): &#8220;I am the hunter!&#8221;<br><strong>Sova </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Nowhere to run!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Brimstone </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Open up the sky!&#8221;<br><strong>Brimstone </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Prepare for hellfire!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Sage </strong>(Ally): &#8220;Your duty is not over!&#8221;<br><strong>Sage </strong>(Enemy): &#8220;You will not kill my allies!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Killjoy</strong>(Ally): &#8220;Initiated!&#8221;<br><strong><strong>Killjoy</strong></strong>(Enemy): &#8220;You should run!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Skye</strong>(Ally): &#8220;Seek them out!&#8221;<br><strong><strong><strong>Skye</strong></strong></strong>(Enemy): &#8220;I&#8217;ve got your trail!&#8221;</p><p><strong>Yoru</strong>(Ally): &#8220;I&#8217;ll handle this&#8221;<br><strong>Yoru</strong>(Enemy): &#8220;Who&#8217;s next&#8221;</p><p><strong>Astra</strong>(Ally): &#8220;World divided&#8221;<br><strong>Astra</strong>(Enemy): &#8220;You&#8217;re divided&#8221;</p><p><strong>Kay/o</strong>(Ally): &#8220;No one walks away&#8221;<br><strong><strong>Kay/o</strong></strong>(Enemy): &#8220;You.

Now, rumours and leaks suggest we’re on the cusp of a fresh iteration: Reaver 3.0.

				<![CDATA[
<p>VALORANT Patch 11.10 will be released on November 11, 2025, and it will change a lot for the players. The key change? A <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-harbor-rework-full-ability-overhaul-release-date-tactical-breakdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete overhaul of the controller agent Harbor</a> that changes how he works significantly. In the meantime, Clove, a top-tier controller who became a frag machine, is getting big nerfs to stop her from being too powerful. With improvements to the user interface, security updates for the competitive queue, and a lot of bug fixes, this is one of the most important updates of the season.</p><p><strong><em>Full Patch Notes for 11.10 are Given Below:</em></strong></p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></h2><h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;GENERAL UPDATES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Team HUD Health Improvements
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Healing Indicator: The top HUD health bar now shows when you or an ally is healing. During recovery, the bar turns teal and fills to reflect healing progress. Once recovered, the bar returns to its normal white color.</li></ul></li><li>We&#8217;ve enhanced the Collections experience for both PC &amp; Console, bringing you improvements such as:
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A grid layout is in, and carousel is out for PC Weapons &amp; Buddies</li><li>New dedicated page for equipping and viewing titles on PC.</li><li>Custom skinline backgrounds across more Collections screens, letting your favorite weapon skins shine</li><li><em>Note: the above changes will be delayed for our players in Korea until 11.11, following some player flow changes</em></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">AGENT UPDATES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Harbor</strong><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The Harbor Rework is finally here! We’ve overhauled Harbor’s abilities to move him into a more aggressive Controller, with a <em>splash</em> of Initiator. High Tide was an iconic part of his kit, and we wanted players to be able to carry over their mastery and creativity from High Tide casts in the past. We’ve moved Cove into the signature slot with a few changes to make it easier to place with precision. This should help Harbor find more ways to block vision for his allies from afar or shield them, depending on the situation. Harbor will be gaining a new ability to help with aggressively taking gun fights, Storm Surge! Reckoning also received a massive update, making it easier to set up his allies to flood into enemy territory.</li><li>Read the updated Ability Tooltips below, and check out our social channels for more content breaking down Harbor’s reworked abilities. We’re very excited for you all to <em>dive</em> in!
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cove
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Changed to the signature ability slot</li><li>EQUIP Cove. ACTIVATE to form a water Smoke in the select location. HOLD FIRE while targeting to move the marker further away, and HOLD ALT FIRE to move it closer. RELOAD to toggle targeting view. REACTIVATE to Shield the water Smoke, blocking any bullets that hit it. The Shielded water Smoke can be destroyed.</li></ul></li><li>High Tide
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Changed to a non-signature ability</li><li>Cost 300 credits</li></ul></li><li>Storm Surge (New)
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>EQUIP Storm Surge. FIRE to throw, creating an explosive whirlpool that Nearsights and Slows enemies within it after a short duration.</li></ul></li><li>Reckoning
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>EQUIP Reckoning. FIRE to unleash the full power of your artifact, releasing a surge of water that barrels forward to Nearsight and Slow enemies that are hit.</li></ul></li><li>We&#8217;ve also updated Harbor’s voice lines to reflect his updated abilities. We added conversation voice lines with Tejo and Waylay and have new lines at the start of the match on Abyss and Corrode.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Clove</strong><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Clove is dominating competitive queue pick rates and preventing other controllers from being picked. These changes are aimed at shaving off Clove’s snowballing power. When Clove’s team gets ahead in advantageous states, they very easily outperform other controllers.
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Ruse
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Ruse charges are now restricted to 1 maximum when Clove is dead</li></ul></li><li>Pick Me Up
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Overheal amount, while Pick Me Up is active, has been reduced from 100 HP → 50 HP</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Omen</strong><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Spectators can now see Omen’s perspective in Dark Cover when he is placing his smokes.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Starting in 11.10, all Ascendant+ players in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR, must enable Riot Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access Competitive queue. Other modes will remain unaffected.
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Why Ascendant+? Our highest ranked players are capable of inflicting the greatest harm when smurfing and are at risk of more competitive integrity violations as an outcome to sharing accounts – i.e. win trading.</li><li>You can check out <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/riot-mobile-verification-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a> for more information on why we’re making this change, or get yourself set up with MFA now using <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415709691667-Multi-Factor-Authentication-How-to-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this how-to guide</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">ESPORTS UPDATES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>We’re bringing Pick’ Ems to GameChangers!
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Starting on November 13, the tournament will open in-client and on the web. Predict the full 10 team double elimination bracket winners for points and earn unique rewards for participating.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">GAMEPLAY SYSTEM UPDATES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A followup to the last patch’s updates on how the “Use Object” button functions (“F” on PC and Square/X on Console by default).
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>To simplify layered debuff states, all persistent attached debuffs will be removed at once by holding the “Use Object” button.
<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>For example, Cypher Dart and Deadlock GravNet will <em>both</em> be removed if they happen to be stacked on you at the same time.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">BUG FIXES</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>General

<p>The latest bundle from Riot Games is getting a lot of attention if you&#8217;re a skin-obsessed player in VALORANT. The VALORANT X account just teased the ORA by OneTap bundle, which promises a cool new look and a full range of weapons for those who want to beef up their armory. In this post, we talk about how the bundle looks and feels, what we know about its price and release date, and whether or not it&#8217;s worth your hard-earned VP. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">First Look at ORA by OneTap </h3><p>From the trailer and player screenshots, the ORA by OneTap bundle leans into a clean, almost clinical design with strong contrast and subtle animation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Iso handpicked this playlist, ORA by OneTap Collection in your shop soon <a href="https://t.co/qD6uZtDrwj">pic.twitter.com/qD6uZtDrwj</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1987898046210797583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure><p><strong>ORA by OneTap Skin Bundle Features:</strong></p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Vandal </li><li>Phantom </li><li>Operator</li><li>Sheriff</li><li>Melee (knife)</li><li>Accessories like Gun Buddies and player cards. </li></ul><p><strong>Color palette &amp; textures</strong>: The colors in the images are mostly black and white, with neon or metallic accents that make the weapons look modern and &#8220;minimalist tech&#8221; instead of being excessively vibrant. This lets them stand out without being too sparkling.</p><p><strong>Animations &amp; audio cues</strong>: Players in the VALORANT community are saying that the pull-out and reload animations are smooth and responsive, although some gamers think that the FX and sound effects might not be as good as those in more expensive bundles.</p><p><strong>Inspect &amp; finishers</strong>: There isn&#8217;t a lot of information available yet, but early footage displays smooth inspection animations and a finisher effect that fits with the bundle&#8217;s style, a polished, toned-down flare instead of an excessive visual overload.</p><p><strong>Overall “feel”</strong>: It looks like &#8220;professional shooter gear,&#8221; more like a special-ops toolkit than a fantasy tool. That makes it ideal for serious gamers who want high-quality skins without the cartoonish look, but it might not be as appealing to people who want the most VFX possible.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Release Date</strong></h2><p>The official reveal post by VALORANT indicates the ORA by OneTap bundle is “in your shop soon.”  However, a specific date has <em>not yet</em> been confirmed at the time of publishing this article.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Price</strong>: </h2><p>As of now, Riot Games has <em>not released</em> the official VP price for the ORA bundle. Community speculation estimates a high-tier price point due to the full weapon set and premium look. Since VALORANT skin bundles in the “Exclusive/Ultra” tiers often cost 8,700–10,700 VP, approximately US$99–120, depending on the <strong>region</strong>, you might expect something in that ballpark. </p><p>The ORA by OneTap bundle is shaping up to be one of the more refined offerings in VALORANT’s skin catalogue. With its sleek, tech-professional aesthetic, full weapon set, and solid animations, it caters nicely to players who want “premium without chaos.”</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-ora-by-onetap-skin-bundle-first-look-price-price-release-date/">VALORANT ORA by OneTap Skin Bundle: First Look, Price, &amp; Release Date</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

<p>Since his debut, Harbor has offered a unique blend of water-themed utility among the Controllers, but his pick-rate and impact in competitive play have remained low. Now, with a confirmed rework on the horizon, the stakes are high: this is the moment for Harbor to finally shine. In this article, we break down the new abilities, discuss the expected release window, and explore how the changes could reshape his role in Valorant.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Changing: Harbor’s Reworked Abilities</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Harbor Rework Abilities Explained | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a><a href="https://t.co/wfFkFhx4BV">pic.twitter.com/wfFkFhx4BV</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1987548733374910672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></figure><p>According to recent leaks and developer teasers, Harbor’s kit is getting a sizeable overhaul in Patch 11.10. Below is a summary of what we know so far:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Previous Kit </h3><p>Before the rework, Harbor’s abilities were:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Cascade (C)</strong> – Equip a wave of water that travels forward, can be stopped early, and slows players hit by ~30 %. </li><li><strong>Cove (Q)</strong> – Equip a sphere of shielding water. Upon impact, it becomes a destructible water shield that blocks bullets. </li><li><strong>High Tide (E)</strong> – Equip a wall of water: fire to send it forward, hold to steer; slow effect on players that hit it. </li><li><strong>Reckoning (X / Ultimate)</strong> – A large pool / geyser-based ultimate that concusses or disrupts enemies. </li></ul><p>The core identity: water control, slowing, and shielding. However, critics have pointed out that his kit lacked the punch or flexibility of other Controllers. </p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reworked Kit:</h3><p>Based on leaks, the rework will retain much of Harbor’s identity (water influence, control) but add new mechanics to improve his viability. The key changes:</p><p><strong>Cascade replaced by a “Splash Grenade”</strong>: One leak states that Cascade (his “C” ability) is being replaced by a splash-grenade type ability. </p><p><strong>Ultimate renamed/revamped to “Tidal Wave”</strong>: The ultimate appears to gain a new thematic name and likely a stronger effect (mass water surge, possibly stun effect) based on leaks. </p><p><strong>Visual / animation improvements</strong>: A teaser shows Harbor manipulating water with renewed intensity, smoother animations, suggesting quality-of-life and visual upgrades.</p><p><strong>Role clarity: Hybrid Controller/Initiator</strong>: Riot seems keen to keep Harbor’s hybrid role, meaning he’ll still have area denial/control tools but also more initiation strength. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Release Date and Patch Info</h2><p>The rework is slated for Patch 11.10, which, according to multiple sources, is expected to drop in mid-to-late November 2025. </p><p>The Harbor rework represents one of the more significant agent updates in recent memory for Valorant. He has the potential to shift from an under-picked Controller to a dynamic hybrid with initiation capability. For the broader scene, casual players, ranked, and pro alike, this is a change worth watching. Once patch 11.10 drops, mastering the new Harbor kit early could give a competitive advantage.</p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-harbor-rework-full-ability-overhaul-release-date-tactical-breakdown/">VALORANT Harbor Rework: Full Ability Overhaul, Release Date &amp; Tactical Breakdown</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>

<p>The latest update for VALORANT, Patch 11.09, is now available. It may not affect the meta as much as a big Agent revamp, but it does make important adjustments to competitive integrity, visual clarity, and bug fixing. Here&#8217;s all you need to know about what&#8217;s new, whether you&#8217;re playing ranked or just easing into the next match.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Major Competitive Integrity Updates</h2><p>One of the most significant focuses of Patch 11.09 is tightening account security and tackling smurfing, boosting, and account-sharing.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Starting with this patch, accounts flagged as <strong>shared accounts</strong> in regions such as North America, LATAM, Brazil, and South Korea will be required to enable Riot Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in order to queue for Competitive mode.</li><li>In addition, the developer team has begun issuing bans to accounts they are confident have been <strong>purchased or boosted</strong>. </li><li>The push emphasizes detection of “shared accounts” (multiple humans using the same account) and “boosting” (higher-skilled players playing on lower-rank accounts) as threats to match integrity. </li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quality-of-Life &amp; Gameplay System Improvements</h2><p>Beyond security, Patch 11.09 introduces targeted improvements to how interactive objects behave and look in-game.</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Interactive Object Highlighting</strong>: Objects like switches, ropes, ziplines, ultimate orbs, and other world interactions now use the standard green highlight color, improving visibility and consistency. </li><li><strong>Interactive Object Prioritization</strong>: When multiple actions are possible (for example, being near a rope and another interactable object at once), the game will now better prioritize the one you’re aiming at or intend to use.<br>These subtle refinements may not feel flashy, but they streamline interaction and make gameplay smoother.</li></ul><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bug Fixes, Map &amp; Agent Patches</h2><p>Patch 11.09 also applies a broad sweep of bug fixes across maps and Agents. Here are some key highlights:</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Map Fixes</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>On map Pearl: A crate on B Site missing collision in certain modes was fixed. </li><li>On map Breeze, A spot where players could destroy utility through a wall was patched. </li><li>On map Abyss: A location where using Deadlock’s GravNet could instantly eliminate teleporting Agents like Yoru and Omen was addressed.</li><li>On the map, Corrode: Adjustments were made to prevent Agents such as Waylay, Jett, and Raze from accessing unintended above-playable-area locations.</li></ul><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent Fixes</h3><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Astra: Fixed a bug where the Star activation sound would play for an already used Star when revived.</li><li>Gekko: Fixed animation bugs with the Wingman defuse and visual effect bugs where Detain visuals showed through thin walls/doors. </li><li>Iso: Fixed a bug where Kill Contract would scale up when spectating Iso with this ability equipped.</li><li>Reyna: Fixed a bug where Empress wouldn’t always progress the mission “Use Your Ultimate Ability”. </li></ul><p><em>Patch 11.09 may fly under the radar for many because it lacks big meta-shaking buffs or nerfs, but it’s a pivotal update for competitive integrity and polish. </em></p><p>The post <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-patch-11-09-account-security-smurf-bans-gameplay-improvements/">VALORANT Patch 11.09: Account Security, Smurf Bans &amp; Gameplay Improvements</a> appeared first on <a href="https://gameriv.com">GameRiv</a>.</p>
