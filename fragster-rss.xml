<![CDATA[ <blockquote><p><b>Summary:</b></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">TALON is no longer part of both the VCT Pacific league and the League of Legends Pacific Championship (LCP) after breaking partnership rules with Riot Games.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">As Riot explained, TALON had major delays in their payments to players and staff, and could not fix its financial issues in time.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Riot Games has yet to find other teams that could replace TALON in both the Valorant and League of Legends league for 2026.</span></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riot Games has removed <a href="https://www.fragster.com/worlds-2025-swiss-stage-round-3-results-fnatic-and-psg-talon-make-early-exits/">TALON</a> from both the VCT Pacific league and the League of Legends Pacific Championship (LCP). The team broke important partnership rules because of serious financial problems. As a result, TALON can no longer compete in these two major Riot leagues, and many people are now unsure about the team’s future. Here’s a breakdown of what happened.</span></p> <h2><strong>Riot Explains Why TALON Was Removed</strong></h2> <p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79752" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-5-1.png" alt="Riot Games Drops TALON from VCT Pacific and LCP (5)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-5-1.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-5-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-5-1-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-5-1-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both VCT Pacific and the LCP explained that <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-SG/news/riot-games-terminates-talon-esports-vct-pacific-partnership">TALON did not meet the financial standards</a> required to stay in the partnership program. Riot said the team had major delays in paying its players and coaches, which is a direct violation of league rules.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riot also said TALON was given several extensions to fix these financial issues. However, the team still couldn’t resolve them. Because of this, Riot made the decision to remove them from both competitions. This impacts all of TALON’s teams, including their League of Legends lineup and their TALON VCT roster in VALORANT.</span></p> <h2><strong>TALON Admits Financial Problems</strong></h2> <p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79753" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-6-1.png" alt="Riot Games Drops TALON from VCT Pacific and LCP (6)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-6-1.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-6-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-6-1-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-6-1-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after the announcement,<a href="https://x.com/talonesportslol/status/1990654953824665722"> TALON released a statement confirming they were dealing with major financial troubles</a>. They explained that they were expecting funding earlier in the year, but delays hurt their ability to keep basic operations running.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">These issues were already public. A crypto trader known as “hedgedhog” previously accused TALON and its CEO of failing to pay interest on a <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/08/talon-esports-ceo-loan-payment-response">$1 million loan</a>. The trader claimed the loan was supposed to be short-term but dragged on for nearly two months. The principal was eventually returned, but the interest payment was reportedly still missing.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">This situation made many fans question the stability of the organization long before Riot removed them from TALON VCT competition.</span></p> <h2><strong>A Big Shock for the LCP and VCT Pacific</strong></h2> <p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79749" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-2-1.png" alt="Riot Games Drops TALON from VCT Pacific and LCP (2)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-2-1.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-2-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-2-1-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-2-1-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many people expected Riot to punish TALON for the issues in their </span><a href="https://www.fragster.com/nongshim-redforce-faces-talon-t1-battles-rrq-in-vct-pacific-stage-2-playoffs-day-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400">VALORANT team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, but seeing them removed from the LCP was much more shocking. TALON also ran </span><a href="https://www.fragster.com/worlds-2025-swiss-stage-round-3-results-fnatic-and-psg-talon-make-early-exits/"><span style="font-weight: 400">PSG Talon in League of Legends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a team linked with Paris Saint-Germain. Because of that strong partnership, most fans thought the LoL team would be safe.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Riot’s decision shows that TALON’s financial problems were far more serious than expected. Losing both their League of Legends and VALORANT spots at the same time is one of the biggest team collapses the region has seen.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the VCT, TALON is now the second partnered team to leave this year, after </span><a href="https://www.fragster.com/riot-games-drops-movistar-koi-from-vct-emea-2026-what-went-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400">KOI’s exit in EMEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Their removal also means the Pacific league must find a new team to fill the TALON VCT slot and represent the region moving forward.</span></p> <h2><strong>What Happens to the Players and Coaches?</strong></h2> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79751" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-4-1.png" alt="Riot Games Drops TALON from VCT Pacific and LCP (4)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-4-1.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-4-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-4-1-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-4-1-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">With TALON officially out, all affected players and staff become free agents. This includes both the VALORANT roster and the League of Legends lineup under PSG Talon. They are now allowed to join other teams immediately.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the VALORANT side, Riot confirmed that the league will open a selective application process to find a new team for the 2026 season. The goal is to choose an organization that can properly represent the Pacific and especially the Thai community, where TALON had strong fan support.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the LCP, Riot will also search for a new partner to take TALON’s League of Legends slot. However, no specific timeline has been shared yet.</span></p> <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79750" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-3-1.png" alt="Riot Games Drops TALON from VCT Pacific and LCP (3)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-3-1.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-3-1-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-3-1-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Riot-Games-Drops-TALON-from-VCT-Pacific-and-LCP-3-1-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.fragster.com/nongshim-redforce-faces-talon-t1-battles-rrq-in-vct-pacific-stage-2-playoffs-day-1/">TALON</a> has now lost its rosters in their VALORANT and LoL divisions, and are also no longer partnered with PSG. Their Dota 2 and Rainbow Six Siege teams are still active, but many people worry about how stable the organization will be in the long run. Meanwhile, the removal of TALON also gives opportunities for other teams to enter the VCT and LCP leagues. As Riot begins evaluating new candidates, fans wait to see who will replace them in both leagues.</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>Writer’s Recommendation:</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liked this article?

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-weight: 400">One​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ of the major off-season LAN events in the VALORANT calendar, Red Bull Home Ground 2025, is back. It is top-level invitational teams and a number of international squads that, through an expanded Play-In format, come together at the tournament. Fans get to see the updated rosters, new strategies, and the rising talents long before the competitive season starts.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">This manual explains the tournament layout, the teams that are taking part, the significant points in the timetable, and the things that viewers can expect from this year&#8217;s edition, even if there were no links.</span></p> <h2><b>VALORANT Red Bull Home Ground 2025 Tournament Format</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79453" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79453" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79453" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/redbull-homeground-schedule-v0-s69xesaajw0g1.jpg" alt="redbull homeground schedule v0 s69xesaajw0g1" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/redbull-homeground-schedule-v0-s69xesaajw0g1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/redbull-homeground-schedule-v0-s69xesaajw0g1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/redbull-homeground-schedule-v0-s69xesaajw0g1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79453" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tournament starts with a comprehensive Play-In phase with 11 teams representing different regions. These challengers fight for very few spots in the Main Event, which is run in a double-elimination bracket. This format assures the teams to have more than one chance of advancement, thereby increasing the level of competition in their matches and giving the possibility for underdogs to gather momentum.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five organizations, namely T1, Fnatic, G2 Esports, Sentinels, and ZETA Division, are directly invited to the Main Event. The standard of competition is high because each of them has strong tactical depth and fan-favorite rosters.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Play-In roster features Cloud9, ENVY, Eintracht Frankfurt, BLX Corp, BXL Zoo, Team Spain, Cubert Academy, Flow Tim Cheese, Team Ra&#8217;ad, and Team Fennel. Hence, the style diversity due to the teams being from North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is what makes the first rounds so unpredictable.</span></p> <h2><b>Event Schedule</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Play-In stage opens on November 13, and the teams face off in groups. The winners from these rounds get the chance to proceed further. Winners and Lower Brackets start the next day, November 14, where the first eliminations and long bracket runs will shape the tournament narrative.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The competition moves on to the Winners Finals on November 15, along with the first series of tie-breaking matches leading to the Grand Finals. The final day, November 16, is filled with Cons vs Pros, a special showmatch, Grand Finals, and the opening ceremony scheduled for late evening GMT.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the matches will be held during late-night hours and go beyond midnight for audiences located in India.</span></p> <p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://www.fragster.com/valorants-ora-by-onetap-bundle-brings-agent-inspired-skins-custom-tracks-and-unique-finisher/">VALORANT’s ORA by OneTap Bundle Brings Agent-Inspired Skins, Custom Tracks, and Unique Finisher</a></strong></p> <h2><b>How to Watch and Attend</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79451" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79451" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79451" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Red-Bull-Home-Ground-2025-large-1.jpg" alt="Red Bull Home Ground 2025 large (1)" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Red-Bull-Home-Ground-2025-large-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Red-Bull-Home-Ground-2025-large-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Red-Bull-Home-Ground-2025-large-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79451" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Hammerstein Ballroom in New York is the live event location for the fans. An electric stage environment is what New York will provide for the live event people. The tournament can be followed by those who are not present in the venue via the official Red Bull Gaming broadcasts on major streaming platforms therefore making it convenient and accessible to everyone everywhere.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Home Ground that took place this year means a lot because top teams have changed their rosters quite a lot. To mention a few, the most talked points are the revamped lineup of Sentinels and the new flex player of Fnatic. So, the event serves as an early preview of the teams before the forthcoming competitive season and it is also a launchpad for the unknown squads to make their ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌mark.</span></p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com/valorant-red-bull-home-ground-2025-format-teams-schedule/">VALORANT Red Bull Home Ground 2025: Format, Teams &amp; Schedule</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com">Fragster</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ SOOP VALORANT League (SVL) 2025 promises to be a thrilling off-season closure of the VALORANT esports world. The six-day event, which takes place from December 2 to 7 at the Sangnam Colosseum in Seoul, features eight teams competing for a US$80,000 prize pool. SVL 2025 represents one of the most awaited off-season events in the region and, therefore, comes at a very critical moment when new formations of rosters, changes of tactics, and momentum-building for the upcoming competitive cycle are underway.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The event still acts as a major platform for both the powerhouses and the newcomers. Making a comeback to the same place that was used for the VCT Pacific League emphasizes its growing status and guarantees a prestigious stage for the teams from Asia and beyond. With an attractive invitation list, a regional qualifier, and an energetic LAN vibe, SVL 2025 is set to provide top-level matches all through the week.</span></p> <h2><strong>SOOP VALORANT League 2025 Teams and qualification format</strong></h2> <div id="attachment_79446" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79446" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79446" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/i1168358750-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="i1168358750 1024x576 (1)" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/i1168358750-1024x576-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/i1168358750-1024x576-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/i1168358750-1024x576-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79446" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Headlining the six-direct-invite teams to the tournament are: DRX, Gen.G, T1, ZETA DIVISION, RRQ, and FNATIC. This roster comprises stable esports organizations which have been successful over the VALORANT ecosyste,m and FNATIC is coming here after a good run at the global stage. Besides as well as the differences of playstyles and regional pedigrees, the group stage will certainly have many high-stakes matches.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining two positions complete the eight-team lineup. One slot is granted to a Southeast Asia qualifier, which comprises eight regional teams like Team Secret, Global Esports, and Motiv Esports. The only team that will proceed to Seoul for the main event is the winner of the qualifiers; thus, the stakes rise for every participant. The last team has not been revealed yet, thus leaving a question mark before the competition kick-off.</span></p> <p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://www.fragster.com/valorants-ora-by-onetap-bundle-brings-agent-inspired-skins-custom-tracks-and-unique-finisher/">VALORANT’s ORA by OneTap Bundle Brings Agent-Inspired Skins, Custom Tracks, and Unique Finisher</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Tournament structure and broadcast details</strong></h2> <div id="attachment_79447" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79447" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79447" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_2025-11-14_122507642.jpg" alt="image 2025 11 14 122507642" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_2025-11-14_122507642.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_2025-11-14_122507642-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image_2025-11-14_122507642-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79447" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">SVL 2025 opens with two groups of four teams, the gro</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ups being double-elimination brackets. This set-up allows the teams to come back from a defeat suffered in their first game and at the same time, consistency and adjustment are rewarded through this format. The leading two teams from each group will proceed to the playoffs, the playoffs being followed by the single-elimination bracket final showdown which will decide the finalists. The grand final best-of-five series will be played as part of the event, ensuring a fitting finale.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tickets for the event will be available from 5 PM KST (7 AM UTC) on November 20, whereas broadcasts will be offered in English, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese. With such good properties as intense competition, representation of the regio,n and interesting tournament format, the SOOP VALORANT League 2025 is bound to be one of the most talked-about in the off-season as fans will turn their focus toward the year-end ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌showdowns.</span></p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com/soop-valorant-league-svl-2025-set-for-december-in-seoul-with-eight-team-field/">SOOP VALORANT League (SVL) 2025 set for December in Seoul with eight-team field</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com">Fragster</a>.</p> ]]>

Riot Games has released the VALORANT 11.10 update, bringing major reworks for Harbor and changes to Clove’s abilities. The patch also adds several gameplay improvements across PC and console. Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new in this update.</span></p> <h2><b>Harbor Gets a Complete Rework</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Harbor Gameplay Rework // Golden Moment - VALORANT" width="860" height="484" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hufZyvfDYRI?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.fragster.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After months of player requests,<a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-11-10/"> Harbor has finally received his long-awaited overhaul in VALORANT 11.10. </a>The rework means a redesign of his abilities, with some completely replaced or removed. To make him more active in fights as an aggressive controller, Riot created his kit around the idea of initiating rather than just defending. Here are major changes in harbor’s abilities:</span></p> <h4><b>Major Ability Changes</b></h4> <p><b>Cove</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; This is now Harbor’s signature ability after the rework. Players get one free charge each round, allowing Harbor to deploy a water smoke that blocks bullets when shielded. The change also lets players choose how far to throw it, making it easier to protect teammates or block vision from a safe distance.</span></p> <p><b>Storm Surge</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; This new ability replaces Cascade and creates a whirlpool which causes every enemy inside to be slowed and nearsighted. This ability gives Harbor’s team more control during pushes. </span></p> <p><b>Reckoning</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8211; Harbor&#8217;s ultimate has also been reworked, and now sends a wave of water that slows and nearsights enemies instead of concussing them. </span></p> <h4><b>Reworked Voice Lines</b></h4> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alongside these changes, Harbor also got updated voice lines to match his new abilities and playstyle. His new dialogue on maps like Abyss and Corrode adds a refreshing touch to his in-game presence.</span></p> <h2><b>Clove Nerfed After Dominating Ranked Play</b></h2> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79419" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-2.png" alt="VALORANT 11.10 Update Brings Major Harbor Rework and Clove Nerfs (2)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-2.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-2-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-2-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-2-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another major part of the VALORANT 11.10 update is the set of nerfs targeting <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Clove">Clove</a>. The nerfs tone down her overall strength to make her kit balanced and at the same level as other controller agents. Her ability to heal and continue fighting even after death particularly made  her a difficult opponent to deal with in both ranked and pray. So, Riot had to make sure that she’s not overpowered.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clove’s Ruse smokes can now only be placed once when she’s dead, which limits her impact after elimination. Her self-healing ability, Pick Me Up, has also been weakened with a lower overheal cap at 50 HP instead of 100 HP. Now, she won’t be able to survive too long in duels, and this forces players to rely more on teamwork instead of solo plays.</span></p> <h2><b>Gameplay, UI, and Console Improvements</b></h2> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79421" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-4.png" alt="VALORANT 11.10 Update Brings Major Harbor Rework and Clove Nerfs (4)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-4.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-4-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-4-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-4-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The VALORANT 11.10 update also improves the game’s quality of life across all platforms. Players can now see when teammates are healing thanks to a new teal-colored indicator in the top HUD. The Collections menu on PC has been revamped with a grid layout and custom skinline backgrounds, giving players an easier and more visually appealing way to manage their cosmetics.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Competitive players in higher ranks now need to <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415709691667-Multi-Factor-Authentication-How-to-FAQ">enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> through the Riot Mobile app to queue for ranked matches. This move helps reduce smurfing and account manipulation in Ascendant rank and above.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Console players are also getting some long-awaited updates. Replays are now live on PlayStation and Xbox, letting players review their matches and analyze gameplay from different angles. The console lobby interface has also been improved for smoother navigation.</span></p> <h2><b>Bug Fixes and Final Touches</b></h2> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79420" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-3.png" alt="VALORANT 11.10 Update Brings Major Harbor Rework and Clove Nerfs (3)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-3.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-3-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-3-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VALORANT-11.10-Update-Brings-Major-Harbor-Rework-and-Clove-Nerfs-3-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The patch includes a long list of bug fixes for agents like Sage, Yoru, Killjoy, and Cypher. A notable fix ensures that the Spike can no longer be planted outside designated areas—a common exploit on some maps. Harbor’s Cove now correctly grants assists, and several visual bugs related to abilities and the HUD have been addressed.</span></p> <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Valorant Patch 11.10 All Changes (Clove Nerf, Harbor Rework)" width="860" height="484" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iDutme4fy8?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.fragster.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="https://www.fragster.com/new-riot-fps-game-may-be-set-in-the-valorant-universe-reports-suggest/">VALORANT</a> 11.10 update is definitely a big one for Harbor and Clove players, seeing as the biggest changes involve these agents. Now, Harbor has finally become a more viable pick, while Clove will be more challenging to play. The UI polish, console features, anti-smurf measures and numerous bug fixes that this patch brings also ensure that VALORANT is smoother and easier to play. With this update, are you ready to jump back in and explore what’s new?</span></p> <blockquote><p><b>Writer’s Recommendation:</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liked this article?

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riot​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Games has confirmed a major rework for Harbor that intends to not only make Harbor a stronger controller but also increase his overall utility in both casual and competitive matches. The update aims to increase the character&#8217;s flexibility, while also improving his crowd control potential and making Harbor more impactful during site executions and defensive holds. Instead of just a few number changes, the developers have gone a step further and actually redefined the whole gameplay of the character&#8217;s abilities.</span></p> <h2><b>High Tide Harbor rework VALORANT</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79261" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79261" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79261" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_High_Tide-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="Valorant Harbor High Tide 1024x576" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_High_Tide-1024x576-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_High_Tide-1024x576-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_High_Tide-1024x576-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79261" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harbor&#8217;s main capability, High Tide, still focuses on the creation of a water wall that the player can control. However, the player will have better control over the shape of the water wall and the cancellation of the wall&#8217;s path. The water wall is effective for mid-round tactical changes. To hinder enemies, the wall will slow those who pass through it.</span></p> <h2><b>Introduction of Storm Surge</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79260" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79260" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79260" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-s-harbor-gets-massive-rework-that-s-dividing-players.jpg" alt="valorant s harbor gets massive rework that s dividing players" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-s-harbor-gets-massive-rework-that-s-dividing-players.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-s-harbor-gets-massive-rework-that-s-dividing-players-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-s-harbor-gets-massive-rework-that-s-dividing-players-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79260" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, the introduction of Storm Surge is a big change which is a replacement for the old Cascade ability. Storm Surge gives Harbor the possibility to throw a water orb at an enemy, which blinds the enemy on the hit, and a slowing zone is created on the ground where the orb lands. With this, Harbor can become a direct crowd controller on the team, which helps teams complete pushes stalling, close corner clearing, or disrupting the opponent&#8217;s strong defensive angles holding.</span></p> <h2><b>Cove Rework for Enhanced Utility</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79258" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79258" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79258" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_Cove-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="Valorant Harbor Cove 1024x576" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_Cove-1024x576-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_Cove-1024x576-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant_Harbor_Cove-1024x576-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79258" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cove has been redesigned to be a smoke orb that can be reactivated to create a</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> temporary bullet-resistant cover. Although the cover can be dismantled by the continuous fire, it allows a short period of protection in situations of high pressure like spike plants, defuses, or passing through a deadlocked choke point. This allows Harbor to make late-round appearances more consistent.</span></p> <h2><b>Updated Ultimate: Reckoning</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79257" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79257" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79257" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-harbor-abilities-1.jpg" alt="valorant harbor abilities (1)" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-harbor-abilities-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-harbor-abilities-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/valorant-harbor-abilities-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79257" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the new design, Reckoning can release one big wave of water which carries out the functions of blinding and slowing the enemies in the area. This change causes Harbor&#8217;s ultimate to be not just a tool for zoning that is only used in certain situations but an ability that can be used to open site takes or to force opponents to leave their secure positions. It extends his presence during coordinated team-end executions.</span></p> <p>Read More: <a href="https://www.fragster.com/when-does-v25-act-6-end-valorant-2026-act-1-start-date-confirmed/">When Does V25 Act 6 End? Valorant 2026 Act 1 Start Date Confirmed</a></p> <h2><b>Overall Impact</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rework moves Harbor to a different class of Controllers, that of a more dynamic one, who can not only shape the battlefield, but also actively influence fighting engagements. That way, teams may see him as a more viable agent on maps where the utilization of layered utility and space control is of utmost importance. As players get used to the revamped abilities, Harbor&#8217;s competitive playtime is likely to increase, thus maybe causing agent metas to change that have been in place for a ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌while.</span></p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com/riot-games-harbor-rework-in-valorant-explained/">Riot Games&#8217; Harbor Rework in VALORANT Explained</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com">Fragster</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riot Games’ rotating Night Market feature is one of the most exciting parts of Valorant and allows players to purchase premium weapon skins for a discounted amount. While the Night Market does not have a strict monthly schedule, it typically takes place every couple of months in the year. The last Night Market was available from September 25, 2025, to October 9, 2025, and many players are looking forward to the upcoming market in November.</span></p> <h2><b>Expected Night Market Window In November 2025</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79109" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79109" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79109" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-next-night-market-July-cover.jpg" alt="Valorant next night market July cover" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-next-night-market-July-cover.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-next-night-market-July-cover-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-next-night-market-July-cover-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79109" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of now, Riot Games has not officially announced the official date of the next Night Market. However, in accord with previous patterns of rotation, players can expect the next Night Market in mid to late November 2025, or at the latest, early December 2025. Also, in recent years, Riot has aligned Night Markets with seasonal events and holidays, so it is highly likely that November will see the new Night Market.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Generally, the Night Market goes live between approximately 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM local server time, depending on region rollout. Once the Night Market has entered the Rotation, players will have about two weeks once the shop goes live to consider if they would like to purchase whichever skins in the Night Market.</span></p> <h2><b>Understanding the Night Market</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Night Market offers every player six random weapon skins from eligible skin collections that haven&#8217;t been released as exclusives or as limited seasonal releases. They are offered at substantial discounts, but the selection is a completely individual and random experience, meaning that two players won&#8217;t see the same offers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Night Market icon typically appears in the top right corner of the in-game menu. Once opened by the player, they can flip each card associated with an offer to reveal it.</span></p> <p>Read More: <a href="https://www.fragster.com/ten-valorant-global-invitational-2025-teams-dates-and-highlights/">TEN VALORANT Global Invitational 2025: Teams, Dates, and Highlights</a></p> <h2><b>What Will Players Get?</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79108" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79108" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79108" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NM-reveal-tarrot-cards.jpg" alt="NM reveal tarrot cards" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NM-reveal-tarrot-cards.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NM-reveal-tarrot-cards-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NM-reveal-tarrot-cards-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79108" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">While it has not yet been confirmed what the skin pool will be for the next rotation, the last Night Markets included collections such as Reaver, Gaia’s Vengeance, Magepunk, and Oni, among other collections.

The patch mainly focuses on Harbor’s long-awaited rework, balancing tweaks to Clove, visual improvements for the Team HUD, and the long-requested Replay System finally arriving on consoles. Along with that, there are multiple bug fixes, gameplay changes, and a new Pick’Ems feature for Game Changers.</p> <h3 data-start="513" data-end="571">Harbor Gets a Major Overhaul with Aggressive New Kit</h3> <p data-start="573" data-end="850">After a long time, Harbor is finally getting a serious rework, shifting him towards a more offensive style while keeping his Controller roots intact. Riot wanted to make Harbor feel like a mix between Controller and Initiator, letting him play more aggressively in gunfights.</p> <ul> <li data-start="854" data-end="1129"><strong data-start="854" data-end="862">Cove</strong> has now moved to the signature ability slot. It can be placed more precisely, and players can use different fire modes to control how far they want to throw it. The shielded bubble blocks bullets until destroyed, giving a mix of safety and control for team setups.</li> <li data-start="1132" data-end="1358"><strong data-start="1132" data-end="1145">High Tide</strong> is no longer his signature and now costs 300 credits. In return, Harbor gets <strong data-start="1223" data-end="1238">Storm Surge</strong>, a completely new ability that drops a whirlpool on the ground, nearsighting and slowing enemies after a short delay.</li> <li data-start="1361" data-end="1519"><strong data-start="1361" data-end="1374">Reckoning</strong>, his ultimate, has been reworked to push water waves that slow and blind enemies, allowing teammates to rush more freely into contested areas.</li> </ul> <p data-start="1521" data-end="1662">Riot also added new voice lines for Harbor, including conversations with Tejo and Waylay, and fresh intros for maps like Abyss and Corrode.</p> <h3 data-start="1759" data-end="1806">Team HUD and Collection Page Improvements</h3> <div id="attachment_79300" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79300" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79300" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-600x450-1.png" alt="Valorant Patch Notes 11.10" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-600x450-1.png 600w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-600x450-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-600x450-1-85x65.png 85w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79300" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot games</p></div> <p data-start="1808" data-end="2197">The in-game Team HUD now displays a teal health bar when players are being healed, offering better visibility during fights. The <em data-start="1937" data-end="1950">Collections</em> section has been redesigned with a grid layout instead of a carousel, while PC players gain a dedicated page for equipping titles and more background options for weapon skins. These updates will roll out in Korea slightly later, on November 11.</p> <h3 data-start="2204" data-end="2259">Multi-Factor Authentication for High-Rank Players</h3> <p data-start="2261" data-end="2550">To strengthen ranked play integrity, Riot now requires <em data-start="2316" data-end="2351">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</em> through Riot Mobile for all players ranked Ascendant or higher in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR. This step aims to reduce smurfing and account misuse in higher tiers, though other modes remain unaffected.</p> <h3 data-start="2557" data-end="2601">Console Players Gain Access to Replays</h3> <p data-start="2603" data-end="2900">Console players finally receive the <em data-start="2639" data-end="2654">Replay System</em>, letting them review matches and study gameplay directly on their devices. Riot also improved the console lobby interface, with smoother navigation between tabs, visible queue timers, and updated layouts for “Select a Queue” and “Map” screens.</p> <h3 data-start="2907" data-end="2939">Bug Fixes and Known Issues</h3> <p data-start="2941" data-end="3263">Riot resolved numerous bugs across agents, including Clove’s revival glitches, Harbor’s assist tracking, and Killjoy’s device icon issues. Some smaller visual problems with Sage, Yoru, and Omen were also addressed. Known issues remain with queue timers and custom lobby resets, which Riot plans to fix in future updates.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </article> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com/valorant-patch-11-10-brings-major-harbor-rework-clove-nerfs-and-console-replays/">Valorant Patch 11.10 Brings Major Harbor Rework, Clove Nerfs, and Console Replays</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fragster.com">Fragster</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Valorant Season 25 is structured with six acts, with each act being part of the yearly progression system put in place by Riot Games. Taking into account the timer in-game for the battle pass, and the fact that acts last for a consistent duration, we expect that Valorant V25 Act 6 is going to end on January 7, 2026. This corresponds with how Riot has managed seasonal rollovers to happen in 2025 &#8211; there is a pattern in the last &#8220;act&#8221; for each season.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Act 6 will be the final act of the 2025 competitive year and will also close out all progression associated with Episode and Act rank rewards. Players will have limited time left in the act to make their competitive push, complete the battle pass, and unlock any remaining limited-time cosmetics. During the last stage of an act, competitive queue rank outcomes will start to tighten, and leaderboard placements often result in closer scores and placement.</span></p> <h2><b>Valorant 2026 Act 1 Start Date</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79114" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79114" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79114" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/All-of-the-VALORANT-season-start-and-end-dates-1-1.jpg" alt="All of the VALORANT season start and end dates 1 (1)" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/All-of-the-VALORANT-season-start-and-end-dates-1-1.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/All-of-the-VALORANT-season-start-and-end-dates-1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/All-of-the-VALORANT-season-start-and-end-dates-1-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79114" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the closing of V25 Act 6, we expect Valorant 2026 Act 1 to begin on January 8, 2026. Keep in mind that updates for multiplayer games begins in different times, so the act start date can variably change by region due to server maintenance schedules. North America usually gets updates first, followed by the Asia region, followed by Europe + other servers globally after. Players can likely expect a short delay or downtime while the game transitions into the new act.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the new season approaches, competitive ranks will be undergoing a soft reset, meaning players will now play placement matches to determine their new starting rank for the year. Along with that, a new battle pass will be released, the reward track will be updated, cosmetic bundles will be available/released, and we can expect some kind of initial balance changes with the 2026 launch patch.</span></p> <p><strong>Read More: <a href="https://www.fragster.com/ten-valorant-global-invitational-2025-teams-dates-and-highlights/">TEN VALORANT Global Invitational 2025: Teams, Dates, and Highlights</a></strong></p> <h2><b>What to Do Before the Reset</b></h2> <div id="attachment_79112" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79112" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-79112" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant.jpg" alt="Valorant" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant.jpg 800w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Valorant-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-79112" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Riot Games</p></div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the season comes to a close, players may want to consider focusing on:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Completing the current season&#8217;s battle pass to earn the last unlocks.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Completing ranked placements or trying to get a higher ACT-ranked badge.</span></li> <li><span style="font-weight: 400">Use any leftover event tokens or limited-time &#8220;shop&#8221; currency prior to the season ending.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Valorant transitions from V25 Act 6 to Valorant 2026 Act 1, we begin a new competitive year with new progression opportunities for players.

You will need to enable MFA to access Competitive Mode if you’re sharing accounts in NA, LATAM, KR, BR. With this change, Riot clearly aims to reduce smurfing and boosting, while other modes remain unaffected.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The detection system will flag suspicious behavior and accounts failing to activate MFA will be restricted. This ensures that competitive matches reflect true player skill rather than borrowed ranks or purchased accounts. <a href="https://www.fragster.com/riot-games-confirms-harbor-rework-coming-to-valorant-later-this-year/">These requirements will soon expand</a> to all higher-ranked players to make consistent standards across higher tier of play.</span></p> <h2><b>Riot’s Continued Crackdown on Smurfing</b></h2> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78722" src="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VALORANT-Patch-11.09_-Riot-Tightens-Account-Sharing-Rules-Improves-Object-Interactions-3.png" alt="VALORANT Patch 11.09 Riot Tightens Account Sharing Rules, Improves Object Interactions (3)" width="1200" height="630" srcset="https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VALORANT-Patch-11.09_-Riot-Tightens-Account-Sharing-Rules-Improves-Object-Interactions-3.png 1200w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VALORANT-Patch-11.09_-Riot-Tightens-Account-Sharing-Rules-Improves-Object-Interactions-3-300x158.png 300w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VALORANT-Patch-11.09_-Riot-Tightens-Account-Sharing-Rules-Improves-Object-Interactions-3-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.fragster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VALORANT-Patch-11.09_-Riot-Tightens-Account-Sharing-Rules-Improves-Object-Interactions-3-768x403.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can now report smurfing players under “Rank Manipulation” to support community involvement.
