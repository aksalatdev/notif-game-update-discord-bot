<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gameriv.com/valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT </a>is a hero shooter-inspired tactical FPS game where each agent has a unique voice line whenever they use their ultimate abilities.</strong></p>



<p>Riot put in a lot of effort to make each of its agents stand out from the others. From speedster Jett to toxic Viper, every one of them has a unique voice line that demonstrates their personality. In the process, it gives every agent more depth in their character.</p>



<p>Additionally, these ultimate voice lines also behave differently depending on whom you are interacting with at the exact moment when you use your ultimate utility. For example, if your allies are close and you are Raze, the voice line warns your teammates of the incoming rockets. In comparison, your opponents will get an entirely different voice line depending on where the ability was activated.</p>



<p>As such, these voice lines become essential sound cues for incoming attacks. Knowing when to take cover in the case of incoming damage-dealing ultimate ability can be the difference between winning and losing a round.</p>



<p>Players of all skill buckets need to remember each of these voice lines in their heads to win rounds. </p>

<p>The iconic “<a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-reaver-halloween-skin-first-look-release-date-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reaver</a>” skin line in Valorant has been a fan-favourite ever since its initial release, combining <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-reaver-2-0-skin-bundle-price-release-date-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark fantasy aesthetics</a> with premium animation and audio. Now, rumours and leaks suggest we’re on the cusp of a fresh iteration: Reaver 3.0. In this article, we’ll take a <em>first look</em> at what’s been revealed so far, cover the expected <em>price</em>, and highlight when you might be able to grab it in the store.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1200" height="717" src="https://gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3-1200x717.png" alt="" class="wp-image-260313"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Look: What We Know So Far</h2>



<p>While official details from Riot Games remain minimal, leaks and past precedent give us solid leads into what Reaver 3.0 may contain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/VALORANTLeaksEN/status/1988306590244762093?s=20
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visual Style &amp; Legacy</h3>



<p>The original Reaver skin-line debuted early in Valorant’s life and served as a testing ground for advanced weapon skin features like custom model, animation, audio, and finisher.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bundle Contents (based on leaks)</h3>



<p>For Reaver 3.0: The leak you referenced from X by VALORANTLeaksEN suggests the new bundle is imminent, although the exact weapon list hasn’t been officially confirmed yet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Premium Features</h3>



<p>Given the Reaver line’s history of being “premium”, we should anticipate:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Upgrade levels (VFX, animation, finisher)</li>



<li>Possibly new variants (colour or material skins)</li>



<li>Melee weapon finisher or special animation<br>This matches how previous premium bundles were structured. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Price </h2>



<p>Based on bundle‐tier pricing data for Valorant skins, here’s what we can reasonably anticipate:</p>



<p>Premium tier bundles (like the original Reaver/major premium sets) often had a price of ~ <strong>7,100 VP</strong> (Valorant Points). According to one pricing guide, premium bundles are listed under 7,100–8,855 VP.</p>



<p><strong>Therefore</strong>, if Reaver 3.0 follows this model, expect something in the 7,100 VP range. If Riot introduces extra features or variant options, it could stretch higher.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Release Date</h2>



<p>As of writing, there is no official confirmation regarding this upcoming skin bundle&#8217;s release date. We&#8217;ll update this article with more up-to-date information as soon as they are available.</p>



<p>The incoming Reaver 3.0 skin bundle for Valorant is shaping up to be a major drop for collectors and competitive players alike. With a strong legacy behind the Reaver line, premium features expected, and a likely price point in the ~7,100 VP range, this could be one of the more desirable bundles of the year. </p>

<p>VALORANT Patch 11.10 will be released on November 11, 2025, and it will change a lot for the players. The key change? A <a href="https://gameriv.com/valorant-harbor-rework-full-ability-overhaul-release-date-tactical-breakdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete overhaul of the controller agent Harbor</a> that changes how he works significantly. In the meantime, Clove, a top-tier controller who became a frag machine, is getting big nerfs to stop her from being too powerful. With improvements to the user interface, security updates for the competitive queue, and a lot of bug fixes, this is one of the most important updates of the season.</p>



<p><strong><em>Full Patch Notes for 11.10 are Given Below:</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;GENERAL UPDATES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Team HUD Health Improvements
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Healing Indicator: The top HUD health bar now shows when you or an ally is healing. During recovery, the bar turns teal and fills to reflect healing progress. Once recovered, the bar returns to its normal white color.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>We&#8217;ve enhanced the Collections experience for both PC &amp; Console, bringing you improvements such as:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A grid layout is in, and carousel is out for PC Weapons &amp; Buddies</li>



<li>New dedicated page for equipping and viewing titles on PC.</li>



<li>Custom skinline backgrounds across more Collections screens, letting your favorite weapon skins shine</li>



<li><em>Note: the above changes will be delayed for our players in Korea until 11.11, following some player flow changes</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">AGENT UPDATES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Harbor</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Harbor Rework is finally here! We’ve overhauled Harbor’s abilities to move him into a more aggressive Controller, with a <em>splash</em> of Initiator. High Tide was an iconic part of his kit, and we wanted players to be able to carry over their mastery and creativity from High Tide casts in the past. We’ve moved Cove into the signature slot with a few changes to make it easier to place with precision. This should help Harbor find more ways to block vision for his allies from afar or shield them, depending on the situation. Harbor will be gaining a new ability to help with aggressively taking gun fights, Storm Surge! Reckoning also received a massive update, making it easier to set up his allies to flood into enemy territory.</li>



<li>Read the updated Ability Tooltips below, and check out our social channels for more content breaking down Harbor’s reworked abilities. We’re very excited for you all to <em>dive</em> in!
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cove
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Changed to the signature ability slot</li>



<li>EQUIP Cove. ACTIVATE to form a water Smoke in the select location. HOLD FIRE while targeting to move the marker further away, and HOLD ALT FIRE to move it closer. RELOAD to toggle targeting view. REACTIVATE to Shield the water Smoke, blocking any bullets that hit it. The Shielded water Smoke can be destroyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>High Tide
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Changed to a non-signature ability</li>



<li>Cost 300 credits</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Storm Surge (New)
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>EQUIP Storm Surge. FIRE to throw, creating an explosive whirlpool that Nearsights and Slows enemies within it after a short duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Reckoning
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>EQUIP Reckoning. FIRE to unleash the full power of your artifact, releasing a surge of water that barrels forward to Nearsight and Slow enemies that are hit.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>We&#8217;ve also updated Harbor’s voice lines to reflect his updated abilities. We added conversation voice lines with Tejo and Waylay and have new lines at the start of the match on Abyss and Corrode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Clove</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clove is dominating competitive queue pick rates and preventing other controllers from being picked. These changes are aimed at shaving off Clove’s snowballing power. When Clove’s team gets ahead in advantageous states, they very easily outperform other controllers.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ruse
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ruse charges are now restricted to 1 maximum when Clove is dead</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pick Me Up
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Overheal amount, while Pick Me Up is active, has been reduced from 100 HP → 50 HP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Omen</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Spectators can now see Omen’s perspective in Dark Cover when he is placing his smokes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Starting in 11.10, all Ascendant+ players in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR, must enable Riot Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access Competitive queue. Other modes will remain unaffected.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Why Ascendant+? Our highest ranked players are capable of inflicting the greatest harm when smurfing and are at risk of more competitive integrity violations as an outcome to sharing accounts – i.e. win trading.</li>



<li>You can check out <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/riot-mobile-verification-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a> for more information on why we’re making this change, or get yourself set up with MFA now using <a href="https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415709691667-Multi-Factor-Authentication-How-to-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this how-to guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ESPORTS UPDATES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We’re bringing Pick’ Ems to GameChangers!
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Starting on November 13, the tournament will open in-client and on the web. Predict the full 10 team double elimination bracket winners for points and earn unique rewards for participating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GAMEPLAY SYSTEM UPDATES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A followup to the last patch’s updates on how the “Use Object” button functions (“F” on PC and Square/X on Console by default).
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>To simplify layered debuff states, all persistent attached debuffs will be removed at once by holding the “Use Object” button.
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For example, Cypher Dart and Deadlock GravNet will <em>both</em> be removed if they happen to be stacked on you at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">BUG FIXES</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>General
<ul class="wp-block-list">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The latest bundle from Riot Games is getting a lot of attention if you&#8217;re a skin-obsessed player in VALORANT. The VALORANT X account just teased the ORA by OneTap bundle, which promises a cool new look and a full range of weapons for those who want to beef up their armory. In this post, we talk about how the bundle looks and feels, what we know about its price and release date, and whether or not it&#8217;s worth your hard-earned VP. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First Look at ORA by OneTap </h3>



<p>From the trailer and player screenshots, the ORA by OneTap bundle leans into a clean, almost clinical design with strong contrast and subtle animation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Iso handpicked this playlist, ORA by OneTap Collection in your shop soon <a href="https://t.co/qD6uZtDrwj">pic.twitter.com/qD6uZtDrwj</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1987898046210797583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>ORA by OneTap Skin Bundle Features:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Vandal </li>



<li>Phantom </li>



<li>Operator</li>



<li>Sheriff</li>



<li>Melee (knife)</li>



<li>Accessories like Gun Buddies and player cards. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Color palette &amp; textures</strong>: The colors in the images are mostly black and white, with neon or metallic accents that make the weapons look modern and &#8220;minimalist tech&#8221; instead of being excessively vibrant. This lets them stand out without being too sparkling.</p>



<p><strong>Animations &amp; audio cues</strong>: Players in the VALORANT community are saying that the pull-out and reload animations are smooth and responsive, although some gamers think that the FX and sound effects might not be as good as those in more expensive bundles.</p>



<p><strong>Inspect &amp; finishers</strong>: There isn&#8217;t a lot of information available yet, but early footage displays smooth inspection animations and a finisher effect that fits with the bundle&#8217;s style, a polished, toned-down flare instead of an excessive visual overload.</p>



<p><strong>Overall “feel”</strong>: It looks like &#8220;professional shooter gear,&#8221; more like a special-ops toolkit than a fantasy tool. That makes it ideal for serious gamers who want high-quality skins without the cartoonish look, but it might not be as appealing to people who want the most VFX possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Release Date</strong> </h2>



<p>The official reveal post by VALORANT indicates the ORA by OneTap bundle is “in your shop soon.”  However, a specific date has <em>not yet</em> been confirmed at the time of publishing this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Price</strong>: </h2>



<p>As of now, Riot Games has <em>not released</em> the official VP price for the ORA bundle. Community speculation estimates a high-tier price point due to the full weapon set and premium look. Since VALORANT skin bundles in the “Exclusive/Ultra” tiers often cost 8,700–10,700 VP, approximately US$99–120, depending on the <strong>region</strong>, you might expect something in that ballpark. </p>



<p>The ORA by OneTap bundle is shaping up to be one of the more refined offerings in VALORANT’s skin catalogue. With its sleek, tech-professional aesthetic, full weapon set, and solid animations, it caters nicely to players who want “premium without chaos.”</p>

<p>Since his debut, Harbor has offered a unique blend of water-themed utility among the Controllers, but his pick-rate and impact in competitive play have remained low. Now, with a confirmed rework on the horizon, the stakes are high: this is the moment for Harbor to finally shine. In this article, we break down the new abilities, discuss the expected release window, and explore how the changes could reshape his role in Valorant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s Changing: Harbor’s Reworked Abilities</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Harbor Rework Abilities Explained | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a> <a href="https://t.co/wfFkFhx4BV">pic.twitter.com/wfFkFhx4BV</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1987548733374910672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to recent leaks and developer teasers, Harbor’s kit is getting a sizeable overhaul in Patch 11.10. Below is a summary of what we know so far:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Previous Kit </h3>



<p>Before the rework, Harbor’s abilities were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cascade (C)</strong> – Equip a wave of water that travels forward, can be stopped early, and slows players hit by ~30 %. </li>



<li><strong>Cove (Q)</strong> – Equip a sphere of shielding water. Upon impact, it becomes a destructible water shield that blocks bullets. </li>



<li><strong>High Tide (E)</strong> – Equip a wall of water: fire to send it forward, hold to steer; slow effect on players that hit it. </li>



<li><strong>Reckoning (X / Ultimate)</strong> – A large pool / geyser-based ultimate that concusses or disrupts enemies. </li>
</ul>



<p>The core identity: water control, slowing, and shielding. However, critics have pointed out that his kit lacked the punch or flexibility of other Controllers. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reworked Kit:</h3>



<p>Based on leaks, the rework will retain much of Harbor’s identity (water influence, control) but add new mechanics to improve his viability. The key changes:</p>



<p><strong>Cascade replaced by a “Splash Grenade”</strong>: One leak states that Cascade (his “C” ability) is being replaced by a splash-grenade type ability. </p>



<p><strong>Ultimate renamed/revamped to “Tidal Wave”</strong>: The ultimate appears to gain a new thematic name and likely a stronger effect (mass water surge, possibly stun effect) based on leaks. </p>



<p><strong>Visual / animation improvements</strong>: A teaser shows Harbor manipulating water with renewed intensity, smoother animations, suggesting quality-of-life and visual upgrades.</p>



<p><strong>Role clarity: Hybrid Controller/Initiator</strong>: Riot seems keen to keep Harbor’s hybrid role, meaning he’ll still have area denial/control tools but also more initiation strength. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Release Date and Patch Info</h2>



<p>The rework is slated for Patch 11.10, which, according to multiple sources, is expected to drop in mid-to-late November 2025. </p>



<p>The Harbor rework represents one of the more significant agent updates in recent memory for Valorant. He has the potential to shift from an under-picked Controller to a dynamic hybrid with initiation capability. For the broader scene, casual players, ranked, and pro alike, this is a change worth watching. Once patch 11.10 drops, mastering the new Harbor kit early could give a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>The latest update for VALORANT, Patch 11.09, is now available. It may not affect the meta as much as a big Agent revamp, but it does make important adjustments to competitive integrity, visual clarity, and bug fixing. Here&#8217;s all you need to know about what&#8217;s new, whether you&#8217;re playing ranked or just easing into the next match.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Major Competitive Integrity Updates</h2>



<p>One of the most significant focuses of Patch 11.09 is tightening account security and tackling smurfing, boosting, and account-sharing.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Starting with this patch, accounts flagged as <strong>shared accounts</strong> in regions such as North America, LATAM, Brazil, and South Korea will be required to enable Riot Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in order to queue for Competitive mode.</li>



<li>In addition, the developer team has begun issuing bans to accounts they are confident have been <strong>purchased or boosted</strong>. </li>



<li>The push emphasizes detection of “shared accounts” (multiple humans using the same account) and “boosting” (higher-skilled players playing on lower-rank accounts) as threats to match integrity. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Quality-of-Life &amp; Gameplay System Improvements</h2>



<p>Beyond security, Patch 11.09 introduces targeted improvements to how interactive objects behave and look in-game.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Interactive Object Highlighting</strong>: Objects like switches, ropes, ziplines, ultimate orbs, and other world interactions now use the standard green highlight color, improving visibility and consistency. </li>



<li><strong>Interactive Object Prioritization</strong>: When multiple actions are possible (for example, being near a rope and another interactable object at once), the game will now better prioritize the one you’re aiming at or intend to use.<br>These subtle refinements may not feel flashy, but they streamline interaction and make gameplay smoother.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bug Fixes, Map &amp; Agent Patches</h2>



<p>Patch 11.09 also applies a broad sweep of bug fixes across maps and Agents. Here are some key highlights:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Map Fixes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>On map Pearl: A crate on B Site missing collision in certain modes was fixed. </li>



<li>On map Breeze, A spot where players could destroy utility through a wall was patched. </li>



<li>On map Abyss: A location where using Deadlock’s GravNet could instantly eliminate teleporting Agents like Yoru and Omen was addressed.</li>



<li>On the map, Corrode: Adjustments were made to prevent Agents such as Waylay, Jett, and Raze from accessing unintended above-playable-area locations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent Fixes</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Astra: Fixed a bug where the Star activation sound would play for an already used Star when revived.</li>



<li>Gekko: Fixed animation bugs with the Wingman defuse and visual effect bugs where Detain visuals showed through thin walls/doors. </li>



<li>Iso: Fixed a bug where Kill Contract would scale up when spectating Iso with this ability equipped.</li>



<li>Reyna: Fixed a bug where Empress wouldn’t always progress the mission “Use Your Ultimate Ability”. </li>
</ul>



<p><em>Patch 11.09 may fly under the radar for many because it lacks big meta-shaking buffs or nerfs, but it’s a pivotal update for competitive integrity and polish. </em></p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by, Agent. The latest bundle for VALORANT is coming out of the lab, and it&#8217;s going to make a big splash. The Nanomight Skin Bundle, which will be available soon, is a colorful new set of cosmetics that has been leaked before its official release. We&#8217;ll tell you all we know so far in this post, including the initial looks, the release date, a preview of the content, and why it might be worth your hard-earned VP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Look &amp; Leak Breakdown</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW BUNDLE: Nanomight | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a> <a href="https://t.co/gSsvwZPtm1">pic.twitter.com/gSsvwZPtm1</a></p>&mdash; Mike | Valorant Leaks &amp; News (@ValorLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorLeaks/status/1983205003939455129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The community has varied feelings about the new pastel style. Some players like it, but others say it &#8220;looks okay, but nothing is new or exciting.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nanomight Skin Bundle Features:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Frenzy</li>



<li>Stinger</li>



<li>Phantom</li>



<li>Guardian</li>



<li>A knuckle-duster style melee</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Variant Colours</h3>



<p>Each weapon appears to have <strong>four pastel color</strong> variants: blue, pink, yellow, and green. These reflect the blobs or shapes seen in the bundle artwork. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4XBMMOXYAApTu4.jpg" alt="Nanomight Skin Bundle" style="width:550px;height:auto"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">image via kohteihep</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additional Cosmetics</h3>



<p>A player card that displays the four coloured blobs in a fun scene is part of the bundle. It’s likely that sprays, buddies, or other accessories might follow the typical bundle pattern, though no official list has confirmed those yet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nanomight Skin Bundle Price</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The exact price has <strong>not</strong> been officially confirmed yet. </li>



<li>Based on precedent for bundles of this size (4-5 weapons + melee + accessories), an estimate is ~ <strong>5,000 to 7,000 VP</strong> (Valorant Points).</li>



<li>As always, each item in the bundle may also be purchased individually at a discounted rate if you don’t want the full set.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nanomight Skin Bundle Release Date</h2>



<p>According to reputable leaks, the Nanomight bundle is expected to go live in the shop on <strong>Thursday, October 30, or Friday, October 31, 2025</strong>, coinciding with the new shop rotation. </p>



<p>The Nanomight bundle has a lot going for it: a new appearance, a lot of core weapon coverage, and a lot of customization options. If you want a new cosmetic set in VALORANT and love bright colors, you might want to set a reminder for this one.</p>

<p>The addition of a separate &#8220;Rank Manipulation&#8221; category to the in-game report system is one of the most exciting things about Patch 11.08. Before, players who were thought to be smurfing or boosting had to be reported under generic categories like &#8220;Cheating&#8221; or &#8220;Sabotaging&#8221; and leave a note with no specific information. Riot hopes that by offering the community a clear way to report issues, they will have better reports and data to work with.</p>



<p>To send a report under this new category:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Open the match settings (press <strong>ESC</strong> on PC)</li>



<li>Find the player you suspect</li>



<li>Select <strong>Report</strong>, then check <strong>Rank Manipulation</strong></li>



<li>Optionally add a description or context</li>



<li>Submit</li>
</ol>



<p>This reporting change is intended as the <strong>first line of defense</strong> in Riot’s broader strategy against smurfing. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Lies Beyond 11.08: MFA, Account Sharing, &amp; Bans</h2>



<p>Patch 11.08 is just the beginning of Riot’s plan. The roadmap includes additional measures in subsequent updates:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Patch 11.09</strong> will roll out the <strong>Riot Mobile Verification (MFA) Beta</strong>, forcing certain accounts flagged for sharing to enable Multi-Factor Authentication via the Riot Mobile app. </li>



<li>Accounts that are<a href="https://gameriv.com/purchased-or-boosted-accounts-will-receive-bans-in-valorant-patch-11-09/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>purchased, shared, or boosted</strong></a> and confirmed by Riot will begin receiving bans. </li>



<li><strong>Patch 11.10</strong> expands the MFA requirement specifically for <strong>Ascendant+ accounts</strong>.</li>



<li>Finally, by <strong>2026</strong>, these rules are expected to be enforced globally, including in the APAC and EU regions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Riot says that a lot of smurfing originates from accounts that are shared or exchanged, which is against their Terms of Service. They want to limit the number of accounts that can be easily exploited by limiting account sharing and linking accounts to specific devices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why These Moves Matter (and What Could Go Wrong)</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Better detection &amp; enforcement</strong>: With more structured reports and MFA, Riot can more reliably detect rank manipulation and boost behavior.</li>



<li><strong>Cleaner matchmaking</strong>: Fewer smurfs means more balanced competitive matches.</li>



<li><strong>Stronger account security</strong>: MFA helps protect users from account theft or misuse.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risks &amp; Concerns</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>False positives</strong>: Some legitimate players might be flagged for “sharing” inadvertently, leading to friction.</li>



<li><strong>Adoption &amp; rollout issues</strong>: The MFA system is in <strong>beta</strong>, and region-by-region rollout could cause confusion or delays. </li>



<li><strong>Incomplete coverage</strong>: Smurfing via alternate accounts (rather than shared ones) might still persist.</li>
</ul>



<p>People in the community are cautiously hopeful. Many players have been asking for tougher action for a long time, and the new reporting system is seen as a good first step. Yet, there are still doubts about how efficiently Riot will enforce punishments and how quickly the restrictions will spread over the globe.</p>



<p>Patch 11.08 is a strong initial step in Riot&#8217;s larger effort to stop smurfing. Riot is showing that VALORANT is entering a new era of accountability by offering players a direct option to report Rank Manipulation and by making it easier for MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and account verification to be added in future patches. The foundation is now established, but whether this will be enough to stop smurfing for good depends on how well it is carried out, how well it is enforced, and how well the community works together.</p>

<p>VALORANT Patch 11.08 is one of the biggest balancing patches that Riot Games has ever released. The changes might completely change the way the game works. This patch makes big changes to agents, weapons, maps, and core systems. The idea is to make VALORANT more focused on tighter gunplay and more crucial utility-related decisions. This article provides you with everything you need to know about the most important buffs, nerfs, and changes that will happen in the update.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Patch Philosophy &amp; High-Level Goals</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Patch 11.08 Gameplay Updates // S25 Act 6 Trailer <a href="https://t.co/IIkEalxJ9A">pic.twitter.com/IIkEalxJ9A</a></p>&mdash; VALORANT (@VALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/VALORANT/status/1977453401148461139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Patch 11.08 isn&#8217;t only about changing numbers. It&#8217;s also about Riot&#8217;s planned change in how the game should &#8220;feel.&#8221; The developers want to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reinforce <strong>round-to-round decision making</strong>: make utility use more strategic, less spammy </li>



<li>Standardize key debuffs and stim systems for consistency and predictability </li>



<li>Bring greater clarity and counterplay to abilities (so you can read, respond, and adapt) </li>



<li>Rebalance weapons to support skillful gunplay (especially refining spraying, recoil, and “protected bullet” behavior)</li>
</ul>



<p>With that in mind, let’s dig into what’s changing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Full Patch 11.08 Notes</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Universal &amp; Systemic Changes</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nearsight</h4>



<p>Nearsight effects (from Fade, Omen, Reyna, Skye, etc.) now have a larger radius—visibility is increased to <strong>7 m</strong> (from 5 m) to make their effect more consistent and distinct from flashes. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Concuss / Stun Effects</h4>



<p>Non-ultimate concussion or stun effects (e.g., Breach’s Fault Line, Astra’s Nova Pulse, Gekko’s Wingman, Neon’s Relay Bolt) are now uniformly <strong>2.5 s duration</strong>, trimmed down from longer, agent-specific values.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Stim Unification</h4>



<p>Combat stim effects (from Brimstone’s Stim Beacon, Reyna’s Empress, KAY/O’s NULL/CMD) have been standardized. The buffs (e.g., reload, fire rate, draw speed) are now consistent across sources and modestly toned down.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rechargeable / Reset Abilities</h4>



<p>Abilities that recharge or reset upon usage (or destruction) are being given <strong>60-second</strong> cooldowns in many cases. That applies to signature abilities of Initiators and some utility agents (e.g., Sova’s Recon Bolt, Breach’s Fault Line, Fade’s Haunt, etc.).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Weapon &amp; Gunplay Changes</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rifles &amp; Spray Behavior</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Protected bullet counts</strong> (the early, highly accurate bullets in a spray) are increased across many rifles (except Guardian) to make sprays more stable and reliable. </li>



<li>Spray patterns are slightly adjusted; directional switches are slower to improve consistency. </li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SMGs (Spectre, Stinger)</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Spectre</strong> sees reduced total spread and better tap-fire behavior, making it more attractive in certain eco/force-buy rounds. </li>



<li><strong>Stinger</strong> gets worse spread under sustained fire and earlier accuracy decay (though total recoil remains unchanged)</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Agent Changes (Buffs &amp; Nerfs)</h3>



<p>Because Patch 11.08 is such a sweeping balance pass, nearly every agent sees some adjustment. Below are the highlights and most impactful shifts.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Initiators &amp; Utility-Heavy Roles</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Signature ability cooldowns (like Breach’s Fault Line, Fade’s Haunt, KAY/O’s Zero/Point) increased from 40s → 60s.</li>



<li><strong>Breach</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fault Line: longer cooldown (40 → 60 s), but faster windup (1.1 s)</li>



<li>Flashpoint: flash duration up to 2.25 s</li>



<li>Rolling Thunder: narrower width, reduced concuss duration, and ultimate cost lowered (points 9 → 8)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>KAY/O</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Zero/Point: cooldown 40 → 60 s</li>



<li>Flash/Drive: maximum underhand flash duration increased (1.5 → 2.25 s)</li>



<li>NULL/CMD: changed to fit stim standardization (fire rate bonus lower, added draw &amp; recovery bonuses)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sova</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Recon Bolt: signature cooldown increased 40 → 60 s </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Controllers</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Omen</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dark Cover: cooldown raised (30 → 40 s)</li>



<li>Paranoia: projectile speed up, travel distance reduced</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Astra</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nova Pulse, Gravity Well, and Nebula all get higher cooldowns (toward 60 s)</li>



<li>Gravity Well’s “fragile” duration trimmed (5 → 2.5 s)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Viper</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Initial decay damage through her wall or smoke reduced (30 → 10)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sentinels &amp; Support Agents</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sage</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Barrier Orb: cost lowered (400 → 300), but health per segment reduced (800 → 600) </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Turret: cooldown on destruction up (45 → 60 s), reactivation delay increased, slow tags per bullet increased</li>



<li>Alarmbot: health down (50 → 20), reactivation time up </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Cypher</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Spycam: now reveals itself when enemies get close, louder audio cues, cooldown when destroyed increased 45 → 60 s</li>



<li>Trapwire: activation windup reduced (1.5 → 0.9 s), adjusted debuff logic (removal of concuss/tether) </li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Deadlock</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>GravNet: cooldown increased (40 → 60 s)</li>



<li>Barrier Mesh: cost lowered, small node health reduced</li>



<li>Sonic Sensor: concuss duration reduced to 2.5 s</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Waylay</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Saturate: hindered duration trimmed 4 → 3 s</li>



<li>Convergent Paths (ultimate): no afterimage, no pushback, narrower width, windup faster, hindered duration shorter, speed buff reduced</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Duelists</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Yoru</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fakeout / Blindside flash durations cut; off-screen flash behavior aligned with Initiator flashes</li>



<li>Clone health reduced, Gatecrash behavior changed (sound cues, destructibility) </li>



<li>Cannot cast Fakeout or Flash during ultimate (Dimensional Drift)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Neon</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High Gear: longer recharge time (20 → 60 s), but sprint duration increased (12 → 16 s) </li>



<li>Relay Bolt: concuss duration trimmed (3.5 → 2.5 s)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Iso</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Kill Contract distance reduced (48 → 36 m)</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Reyna</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Leer health down (80 → 60)</li>



<li>Empress: matches stim standardization changes (reload, fire rate, draw, recovery) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Map Changes</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Abyss (B Site &amp; Mid Adjustments)</h4>



<p>The B site has been redesigned with tweaks to defense and attacker paths, especially focusing on how players rotate and post-plant. Mid has shifts to influence rotation flow.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pearl</h4>



<p>Pearl returns in this patch, with updates mostly on <strong>B Long</strong> and <strong>B Site</strong>, making post-plant defense harder for attackers and giving defenders new control tools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meta Implications</h2>



<p>The VALORANT community is bracing for major changes. Some players applaud the push back toward gunplay and more deliberate utility use, while others fear certain agents (like Yoru) are being hit too hard. > “This is one of the best updates… but Yoru is basically dogshit now.” </p>



<p>Key shifts we expect:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Duels and aim will gain more weight; ability spam will be less reliably oppressive</li>



<li>Agents who could dominate by utility combos may see less dominance</li>



<li>Team composition diversity may increase as overcentralized picks get reevaluated</li>



<li>Adaptation time will be crucial—expect a meta reset period</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Patch 11.08 is arguably one of VALORANT’s most ambitious balance overhauls. Riot is making serious bets: That utility should be powerful but readable, that gunplay should underpin engagements, and that consistency through unified debuffs, stims, and cooldowns can lift the skill ceiling.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Riot Games is getting ready to show off its next premium skin, Dolmir&#8217;s Revenge, as VALORANT Patch 11.08 is coming out soon. This skin line promises to be one of the most visually appealing bundles of 2025, with a mystical, crystalline look and strong fantasy associations. This is everything we know thus far, from leaks and teasers to the price, release date, and in-game features we expect.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Look &amp; Leaked Teasers</h2>



<p>People in the community who leak information and mine data have already started to share previews of Dolmir&#8217;s Revenge. Leaked information suggests that the bundle has a strong &#8220;magic and crystals&#8221; theme, with weapons that look like they are made of floating, enchanted stones that break apart and come back together during inspection animations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Bundle &#8211; &#39;DOLMIR&#39;S REVENGE&#39; // <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VALORANT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VALORANT</a> <a href="https://t.co/dK35HV9WWg">pic.twitter.com/dK35HV9WWg</a></p>&mdash; Valorant News (@ValorINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorINTEL/status/1977756085889970657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>One notable piece of leaked art shows a staff-like weapon, glowing runes, and blade elements, reinforcing the fantasy aesthetic. </p>



<p>Reddit users have also chimed in with early snapshots:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Bundle preview image: … The Dolmir&#8217;s Revenge bundle includes: Classic, Vandal, Guardian, Melee, Odin”<br>“That inspect animation is insane lol” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>These comments hint at high community excitement and suggest that the inspection/animation design may be a highlight of this bundle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dolmir&#8217;s Revenge Features:</h3>



<p>Based on credible sources, here’s a breakdown of the expected contents:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Vandal</li>



<li>Guardian</li>



<li>Classic</li>



<li>Odin</li>



<li>Melee weapon — likely branded <strong>Dolmir’s Judgment</strong>, a dual-wield setup combining a staff and sword </li>
</ul>



<p>There are rumors that each weapon comes in four elemental color variants: purple (base), green, blue, and yellow. These weapons break up into floating crystalline parts during inspect animations, which adds a dynamic visual effect.</p>



<p>The <strong>finisher effect</strong> is also expected to echo the inspection visuals: the corpse of the defeated enemy may form an arcane golem of glowing rock before disassembling back into crystals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Price &amp; VP Estimate</h2>



<p>Riot has not officially confirmed pricing, but speculations place Dolmir’s Revenge in a high tier, likely <strong>above 7,000 VP</strong> for the full bundle. </p>



<p>Based on all the effects of this skin line and past estimations, this skin line may be “Ultra Edition,” putting standalone weapon prices around <strong>2,475 VP each</strong> (~USD $25) and estimating the full bundle to fall between <strong>8,800 – 11,000 VP</strong> (~USD $90–100) depending on variant tiers. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Release Date </h2>



<p>Dolmir&#8217;s Revenge should drop alongside the VALORANT patch 11.08 on October 16th, 2025.</p>
